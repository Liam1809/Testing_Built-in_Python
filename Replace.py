# The next string method we will cover is .replace(). Replace takes two arguments and replaces all instances of the first argument in a string with the second argument. The syntax is as follows

# string_name.replace(character_being_replaced, new_character)
# Great! Letâ€™s put it in context and look at an example.

# >>> with_spaces = "You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth"
# >>> with_underscores = with_spaces.replace(' ', '_')
# >>> with_underscores
# 'You_got_the_kind_of_loving_that_can_be_so_smooth'
# Here we used .replace() to change every instance of a space in the string above to be an underscore instead.

empty_string = ''
replaced = empty_string.replace('', '!!!')
print(replaced) # !!!

example_string = "code"
result = example_string.replace('', '==')
print(result) # ==c==o==d==e==
